1. nfd-start
2. python3 app.py
3. Open http://localhost:5001
4. Go to Device Boostrapping page, upload a QRCode
5. Click "Bootstrap" button.
6. You can see the device in Device List and Service List page.
7. Use NDN Ping to send out Interests
  - Name: /ndn-iot/%0B/<device id>/%00 (unicast) or /ndn-iot/%0B/%00 (multicast)
      (If you see "/ndn-iot/%01/%0B/device-47787" on the Service List, write "/ndn-iot/%0B/device-47787/%00")
  - Application Parameter: Write the lightness you want
  - Signed Interest: True
      (If it's set to False, the client should say "No signature. Ignore the command." and ignore that Interest.)
8. If the controller crashes, ask all clients to restart and then go back to step 5. There's no need to redo the QR code.
